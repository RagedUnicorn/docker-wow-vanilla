# SQL Migration File Format

SQL Migration is an ordinary SQL file.

File name must have the following format:

    YYYYmmddHHMMSS_database.sql

'YYYYmmddHHMMSS' should be the current date in UTC.
'database' must be one of 'characters', 'world' or 'logon'.

For example:

    20140320193109_world.sql

First line in the file must be the following:

    INSERT INTO `migrations` VALUES ('YYYYmmddHHMMSS');

The date must be the same as in the file name.
